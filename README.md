# Tier1_SoloProject
I am applying for the Product Owner role in Voyage 26 (shadowing). I have attached the solo project – it is a basic one page, 3 sections: home (with image carousel, about section, contact form). 
JavaScript functions:
- image carousel
- read more/read less (for the about text)
- contact form with validation (all required fields)
- scroll

For Tier 1 – landing page, I drafted an example how I would set the vision & epics for a fictional travel agency.

„Visit ABC” is a website that provides tourists with information on the ABC location. Designed for the „ABC Travel Agency”, that provides guided tours and business travel opportunities, the website aims to help the agency gain visibility on the market, thus increasing the customer base and cashflow. Potential customers would get insights on the ABC location such as: places to visit, events, accomodation, guided tours – all bookable by contacting the „ABC Travel Agency”.
